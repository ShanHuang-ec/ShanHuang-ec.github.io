I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [DIW Berlin Graduate Center] in the Department of Firms and Markets and at the [Berlin School of Economics].

My primary research interests are in empirical health economics and applied microeconometrics. I am also interested in the intersections of health economics with digital economics, behavioral economics, and empirical industrial organization. I currently work on topics related to physician behavior and antibiotic prescribing and resistance.

I am also affiliated with the [University of Copenhagen] and [BCCP Berlin].
