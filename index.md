I am a PhD candidate in Economics in the Department of Firms and Markets at the [DIW Berlin Graduate Center] and at the [Berlin School of Economics].

My research interests are in health economics and applied microeconometrics. I am particularly interested in the intersections of health economics with behavioral economics, the digital economy, and empirical industrial organization. I currently work on topics related to physician behavior and antibiotic prescribing and resistance.

I am also affiliated with the [University of Copenhagen] and [BCCP Berlin].

I will be visiting [Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley], from September to December 2021.
