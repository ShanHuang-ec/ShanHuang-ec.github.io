I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich. I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Copenhagen in 2023. During my PhD, I was based at the DIW Berlin Graduate Center/Berlin School of Economics.

My research interests are in health economics and applied microeconomics. I currently work on topics related to physician decision-making and antibiotic prescribing and resistance.
