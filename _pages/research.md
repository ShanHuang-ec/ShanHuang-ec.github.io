    Antibiotic resistance is a severe problem within our current health systems. One of the main strategies to combat the rise of antibiotic resistance is to improve physicians' antibiotic prescribing practices. However, this strategy requires that differences in physicians' practice styles have a sufficient impact on the antibiotic intake in the outpatient population. In this paper, we investigate how the physician identity affects patients' antibiotic intake and health outcomes. We first show that geographic variation in antibiotic intake exists even in a generally low-prescribing country such as Denmark, and that patterns of variation are determined by prescriptions from general practitioners. We then investigate the extent to which physician effects contribute causally to variation in antibiotic prescribing between general practitioner clinics when patient or regional differences are hold fixed. We also relate physician effects to physician characteristics to learn about which elements characterize practice style differences. At last, we examine the effect of physicians' prescribing styles on patient health measured by preventable hospitalizations due to infections. To separately identify the effect of physician differences from patient and geographical differences, we leverage quasi-experimental variation in patient-physician relations due to physician exits from general practitioner clinics.

	Starting from December 2012, insurers in the European Union were prohibited from charging gender‐discriminatory prices. We examine the effect of this unisex mandate on risk segmentation in the German health insurance market. Although gender used to be a pricing factor in Germany's private health insurance (PHI) sector, it was never used as a pricing factor in the social health insurance (SHI) sector. The unisex mandate makes PHI relatively more attractive for women and less attractive for men. Based on data from the German socio‐economic panel, we analyze how the unisex mandate affects the difference between women and men in switching rates between SHI and PHI. We find that the unisex mandate increases the probability of switching from SHI to PHI for women relative to men. On the other hand, the unisex mandate has no effect on the gender difference in switching rates from PHI to SHI. Because women have on average higher health care expenditures than men, our results imply a worsening of the PHI risk pool and an improvement of the SHI risk pool. Our results demonstrate that regulatory measures such as the unisex mandate can affect risk selection between public and private health insurance sectors.
